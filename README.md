odoo-connector
==============

This is a port of [OCA OpenERP connector] (https://github.com/OCA/connector) 
for Odoo 8.0. 

*Odoo Connector is a powerful framework to develop any kind
of bi-directional connector between Odoo and
any other software or service.*


A major revision is expected for this porting because of 
the new APIs in Odoo 8.0
