odoo-connector
==============

This is a port of [OCA OpenERP connector] (https://github.com/OCA/connector) for Odoo 8.0. 

*OpenERP Connector is a powerful framework to develop any kind of bi-directional connector between OpenERP (Open Source ERP) and any other software or service.*


A major revision is expected for this porting because of changes of Odoo 8.0 APIs.
